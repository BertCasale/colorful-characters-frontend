# Colorful Character

[Live Site](https://colorful-characters.netlify.app/)

## Description 

There tends to be a lack of diversity in video games. Colorful Characters helps anybody of any background find characters that they can relate to. Community ran, so users can submit games and characters that are good LGBTQ, people of color, or disabled representation.

## Features

View all characters, sorted by the game alphabetically, or all games, sorted by release year, that have any kind of representation or filter down based on whether they are LGBTQ, people of color, or disabled. You can also search characters based on name or specific type of diversity, or search games based on name or platform. You can view an individual character or game to see more information about it, characters have more in-depth labels for their diversity types, while games have a list of their diverse characters. Users can fill in a form to update or add a game or character to the database.

## Planned Features

- User authentication
- User can add a game to wishlist/play later
